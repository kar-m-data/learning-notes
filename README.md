# Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and resources while learning Data Analysis tools and languages.

I believe in building strong foundations â€” these notes help me organize what Iâ€™m learning and track my progress.

## ðŸ§  Topics covered:
- SQL
- Excel
- Python (in the future)
- Data theory

This repo will grow as I keep learning!
